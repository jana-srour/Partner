            </h2>
            <p>
              This Refund Policy explains how refunds are handled for paid
              Partner subscriptions and services provided by Novera Labs.
              By purchasing a Partner subscription, you acknowledge and agree
              to this policy.

              2. Free Trial
            </h2>
            <p>
              Partner may provide eligible customers with a free trial before
              a paid subscription begins. No refund is applicable to a free
              trial because no subscription charge is made during the trial
              period.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              If a paid subscription begins after the trial period, the
              applicable subscription and refund terms below will apply.

            </h2>
            <p>
              PARTNER subscriptions are billed according to the plan and
              billing interval selected during checkout. Subscription prices
              are displayed before payment is completed.

              4. Refund Eligibility
            </h2>
            <p>
              Customers may request a refund for a recent subscription payment
              when there is a legitimate reason for the request. Refund
              requests are reviewed individually and may be approved at the
              discretion of Novera Labs, subject to applicable consumer
              protection laws.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Where applicable law provides a mandatory right to a refund,
              cancellation, or withdrawal, those legal rights remain
              unaffected by this policy.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Customers may cancel their subscription through the available
              PARTNER billing or customer portal tools. Cancellation normally
              prevents future subscription renewals but does not automatically
              refund charges that have already been processed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              If you cancel after a payment has already been processed, you may
              contact us to request a refund for consideration.

            </h2>
            <p>
              If you believe you were charged more than once for the same
              subscription period or were charged incorrectly, please contact
              us as soon as possible. We will review the transaction and, when
              appropriate, correct the charge or issue a refund.

            </h2>
            <p>
              If a payment fails, your subscription may be placed into a
              restricted or past-due state. Failed payments do not
              automatically qualify for a refund because no successful charge
              may have occurred.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Approved refunds are generally returned through the original
              payment method used for the transaction. The time required for
              the refund to appear may depend on the payment provider and the
              customer's financial institution.
